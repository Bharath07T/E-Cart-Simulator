# E-Cart Simulator

## Overview
The E-Cart Simulator is a simple web-based application that simulates an online shopping cart. It allows users to log in and manage items in their shopping cart, including adding items, removing items, and calculating the total cost of the cart. This project demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end development.

## Features

### Login Page
- **User Authentication**: Users can log in by entering their username and password.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes.

### Shopping Cart Page
- **Add Items**: Users can add items and their prices to the cart.
- **Remove Items**: Users can remove items or replace inputs for new items or prices.
- **Calculate Total**: Calculates and displays the total cost of the cart items.
- **Clear Cart**: Clears all items from the cart.
- **Dynamic Display**: Updates the cart list dynamically as items are added or removed.
